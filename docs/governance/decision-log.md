# Decision Log

Append-only record of meaningful decisions in CommonUnity. One line per entry. Add a new entry whenever:

- An architecture decision is taken or revised.
- A milestone integrity audit is completed (see [`./audit-rituals.md`](./audit-rituals.md)).
- A scope change is accepted or rejected.
- A live infrastructure decision is made (domain, service, provider, SMTP, etc.).

Format:

```text
- YYYY-MM-DD — <short title> — <decision / outcome>. <link to PR, audit, or context>.
```

Keep entries terse. The full context belongs in the linked artifact, not here.

## Entries

- 2026-05-16 — Om Cipher v1 implementation plan archived; Bhramari treated as optional measured resonance with sealed baseline + append-only refinement — Plan committed at [`../product/om-cipher-v1-implementation-plan.md`](../product/om-cipher-v1-implementation-plan.md). Fixed identity inputs (birthdate, name, Gene Keys, Human Design) remain Compass-sealed and immutable. Bhramari is distinguished as a somatic measurement: optional in v1, with `bhramari_baseline_hz` sealed at first capture and later captures stored in append-only `om_cipher_resonance_events`. v1 visual use is minimal (palette accent + metadata); full cymatic/harmonic/motion layer is v1.1+. Living Profile UX and additive migration constraints preserved.
- 2026-05-16 — Documentation foundation v0.1 — Established `/docs` structure (foundation, architecture, product, governance, handoffs). Architecture v0.2 brief and next-thread handoff adopted as canonical sources. Branch: `docs/foundation-v0.1`.
- 2026-05-16 — Adapted 8 limbs adopted as audit framework — The 8 limbs are now both the decision-making frame (pre-build) and creation-audit frame (per milestone). See [`./audit-rituals.md`](./audit-rituals.md).
- 2026-05-16 — Documentation system surfaces — GitHub is source of truth; Notion is human workspace; Railway is deployment/runtime reference. See [`../README.md`](../README.md).

- 2026-05-28 — Golden Thread / Sutra framework adopted as OM Field orientation layer — Patanjali's Yoga Sutras named explicitly as a primary orientation text for the OM Field, internal use only, no Sanskrit in user-facing surfaces. Three internal documents added: [`../foundation/om-field-golden-thread.md`](../foundation/om-field-golden-thread.md) (full framework), [`../foundation/nexus-guidance-charter.md`](../foundation/nexus-guidance-charter.md) (behavioural rules for Nexus), [`../foundation/codex-golden-thread.md`](../foundation/codex-golden-thread.md) (compressed codex entry). Gene Keys, Om Cipher, Human Design, cymatics, and Bhramari are framed as modern symbolic expressions of the same underlying field. The eight limbs continue as the audit instrument; the Golden Thread sits one layer above. Branch: `golden-thread-sutra-framework`.
